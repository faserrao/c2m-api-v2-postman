> 5. ⚠️ GitHub Actions has a minor OpenAPI validation issue that needs investigation

⏺ The GitHub Actions is still failing because the examples field is being added somewhere in the pipeline. Let me find where this is happening:

⏺ Search(pattern: ""examples":", path: "openapi/overlays", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ List(openapi/overlays)
  ⎿  Listed 5 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "StandardResponse", path: "openapi/overlays/auth.tokens.yaml", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Let me check the Makefile to see how the OpenAPI spec is built:

⏺ Search(pattern: "overlay.*apply|merge.*yaml", path: "Makefile", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Let me check what creates the final spec:

⏺ Search(pattern: "c2mapiv2-openapi-spec-final\\.yaml", path: "Makefile", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Let me look for where the final spec gets created:

⏺ Search(pattern: "OPENAPI_SPEC_FINAL.*=|openapi-spec-final.*:", path: "Makefile", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Search(pattern: "spec-final", path: "Makefile", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The spec-final seems to come from the base spec. Let me check if there's a script that adds the examples:

⏺ Bash(\
      find . -name "*.py" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.sh" | xargs grep -l "examples.*success.*value" 2>/dev/null | grep -v ".git")
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> read the test data generation guide that you generated - maybe that will help

⏺ Read(TEST_DATA_GENERATION_GUIDE.md)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! The guide explains it - add_examples_to_spec.py is adding examples to the spec. Let me check this script:

⏺ Read(scripts/test_data_generator_for_openapi_specs/add_examples_to_spec.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)
